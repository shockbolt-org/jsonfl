# JsonFL Sketches

The idea of jsonFL is to be a json pattern that defines structure, behavior and validation of simple forms (possibly more complex forms in the future) in a simple and intuitive way.

These sketches should register the brainstorm proccess to define the first spec of the jsonFL.


### Features

This document will also register the features that jsonFL should be capable of handle:

* Form groups - A form made with jsonFL must be able to be divided into multiple sessions.

* Conditional fields - The fields in the form must be able to only be rendered and validated on specific situations

* Conditional or dynamic attributes - the fields attributes must be able to change based on the form state.
